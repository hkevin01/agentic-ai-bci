# Agentic AI Assistant for BCI Research

An intelligent research assistant powered by LangChain and Claude that helps neuroscience researchers query neural datasets, generate summaries, and plan experiments.

## 🧠 Overview

This project combines cutting-edge AI tooling with practical laboratory support for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) research. The assistant leverages agentic workflows to provide researchers with intelligent analysis, experiment planning, and data interpretation capabilities.

## ✨ Features

- **Neural Dataset Querying**: Intelligent search and analysis of BCI datasets
- **Research Summaries**: Automated generation of literature reviews and experimental summaries
- **Experiment Planning**: AI-assisted experimental design and protocol development
- **Data Analysis**: Advanced neural signal processing and interpretation
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly web interface for researchers

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **AI Framework**: LangChain for agentic workflows
- **Language Model**: Claude (Anthropic) for advanced reasoning
- **ML Models**: Hugging Face Transformers for specialized neural analysis
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI + Streamlit for interactive interface
- **Data Integration**: Public BCI datasets (OpenNeuro, PhysioNet, etc.)
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib for neural data visualization
